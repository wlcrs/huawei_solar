      ## Relevant debug logs

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Just copy&pasting the error from the HA `System → Logs` page is insufficient in 95% of the cases.
      >
      > **You MUST gather debugging logs.**

      1. Enable debug logging
         ![Enable Debug Logging menu entry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wlcrs/huawei_solar/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/images/enable-debug-logging.png)
      2. Reload the integration
      3. Perform the action that triggers the error (if applicable)
      4. Stop debug logging: a text file will be downloaded.

      Full instructions here: ['Debug Logs and Diagnostics' from the HA documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics)

      If you are having problems during initial setup of this integration, you'll need to manually gather these logs. To do this, add the following lines to your `/config/configuration.yaml` and restart HA:

      ```yaml
      logger:
        default: debug
        logs:
          custom_components.huawei_solar: debug
          huawei_solar: debug
          tmodbus: debug # only include this if you're having connectivity issues
      ```

      Make sure to check for relevant log lines in the **Full logs** on the Logs settings page [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your Home Assistant logs.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/logs.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/logs/?)

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Do NOT copy&paste info from the summary that you see when going to `System → Logs`, always use "Show raw logs" and look there.
